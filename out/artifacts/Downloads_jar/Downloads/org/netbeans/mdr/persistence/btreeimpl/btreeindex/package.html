<body>

Together, the btreestorage and btreeindex packages provide the btree storage

implementation for the NetBeans meta-data repository.  btreeindex contains

the implementation of a btree structure for storing key-value pairs.  It is used

by the repository in two ways: as a primary index on the BtreeDatabase, and as

a way to store MOF associations.  In the former case, a key-value pair stored

in the index consists of a MOFID and the offset into the repository file

where that object is located. 

<p>

The btree index implementation is a general-purpose data structure and

is almost entirely independent of the

btreestorage implementation.  However, there are a few dependencies which 

would need to be addressed if this code was to be used with some other

storage mechanism.  These are listed in the Btree class.



<h2>Main classes</h2>

<h3>Btree/SinglevaluedBtree/MultivaluedBtree/MultivaluedOrderedBtree</h3>

<p>

These implement the Index interface and corresponding subinterfaces 

SinglevaluedIndex, MultivaluedIndex, and MultivaluedOrderedIndex.

They contain the persistent state 

of a Btree and the public interface methods for accessing it.  

<h3>BtreePage</h3>

<p>

The main logic for searching and updating the structure of a

Btree is contained in the BtreePage class. Subclasses representing specific

types of pages handle retrieval and updates of the items on the page.

<h3>BtreePageSource/BtreeMDRSource/BtreeFileSource</h3>

<p>

BtreePageSource is an interface through which a Btree creates and retrieves 

its pages.  The BtreeFileSource implementation is used for the primary

repository index, whose pages are stored in their own file.  The 

BtreeMDRSource implementation is used for the MOF association indexes,

whose pages are stored as MOF repository objects.

<h3>EntryTypeInfo</h3>

<p>

All data stored in a Btree index is stored in a byte array.  EntryTypeInfo

is an abstract class with a subclass for each type of data that can be

stored in a Btree (defined in org.netbeans.mdr.persistence.Storage.EntryType).

These implement methods for converting an Object of the appropriate type

back and forth between the byte array representation and for doing comparisons

of keys stored in the byte array format.
